# About

As a poetry enthusiast, I describe myself through it, but never with the arrogance of thinking that my own words could fully define who I am.  

That’s why I borrow the words of **Elmar Carvalho**, from one of the greatest works I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading, *The Rose of General Winds*:

> ## (In)Definition  
> I am the one  
> who hesitates, absorbed  
> in the thresholds that permeate  
> and mediate what was  
> and what could have been.  
> I am the one who oscillates, perplexed,  
> between sleep and wakefulness,  
> inventing dreams never dreamt  
> and nightmares never invented.  
> I am the one  
> who sets fire  
> and dances upon the embers  
> and the ashes of chaos,  
> and dreams of not being  
> the being that is  
> and is not.

I am Brazilian, born in **Caxias do Sul** in **1997**. I have italian blood, italian culture and brazilian culture.
Graduated in **Biological Sciences** from the *University of Caxias do Sul*,  
and Master in **Genomic Sciences and Technology** from the *University of British Columbia*.

I’ve been studying philosophy and poetry since 2014 and here, I intend to archive what I create through the at times organized union of words and thoughts.<br>
My heart is half dead, but will live as long as we create poetry.

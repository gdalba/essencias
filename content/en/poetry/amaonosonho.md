She reached out her hand.<br>
Just like that.<br>
She said nothing.<br>
She didn’t need to.<br>
In that open palm<br>
was all the tenderness in the world,<br>
all the guilt in the world,<br>
the whole world.<br>

And on her face,<br>
soft,<br>
was born a smile<br>
of someone who<br>
never<br>
stopped loving me.<br>

And I cried so much, my God!<br>
How I cried.<br>
The tears washed my soul,<br>
my fears all defeated,<br>
my paranoias shelved<br>
for later.<br>

Then I —<br>
trembling like a letter forgotten in a drawer,<br>
with the eyes of someone who saw the love of their life<br>
close the door slowly,<br>
as if with pity,<br>
but without return —<br>
accepted.<br>

I did so with an ancient fear,<br>
with the absurd dread<br>
of losing what’s already gone.<br>
As if there were still time<br>
to save<br>
the irreparable.<br>

And I was so happy!<br>

But dreams do not lie.<br>
Dreams simply echo<br>
in silence<br>
what waking life<br>
screams.<br>

I woke up with my hand still raised.<br>
No other hand touched mine.<br>
The house was quiet.<br>
Construction noises<br>
woke me up, already tired.<br>
The room still intact.<br>
The body still whole<br>
except for the heart,<br>
shattered —<br>
like a plate thrown<br>
onto a kitchen floor<br>
no one cleans anymore.

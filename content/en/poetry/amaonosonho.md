She reached out her hand<br>
and said nothing.<br>
She didn’t need to.<br>
In that open palm<br>
was all the tenderness in the world,<br>
and all the guilt in the world,<br>
and all the whole world.<br>

And on her face,<br>
soft, sweet face,<br>
was born a smile<br>
of someone who<br>
never stopped loving me.<br>

And I cried so much, my God!<br>
How I cried.<br>
The tears washed my soul,<br>
my fears all defeated,<br>
my paranoias shelved<br>
for later.<br>

Then I, trembling,<br>
accepted.<br>

I did so with absolute fear,<br>
with the absurd dread<br>
of losing what was already gone.<br>
Hopelessly hoping there were still time<br>
to save the irreparable.<br>

And I was so happy!<br>

But dreams, alas, do not lie.<br>
And so I woke up with my hand still raised,<br>
yet no other hand was there to touch mine.<br>
The house was quiet.<br>
Construction noises woke me up,<br>
already tired.<br>
The room still intact.<br>
The body still whole<br>
except for the heart,<br>
shattered —<br>
like a plate thrown<br>
onto a kitchen floor<br>
no one cleans anymore.

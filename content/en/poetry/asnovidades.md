Daily life is a parade of monotony,<br>
except on the occasional day<br>
when, inside out, we wear a suit<br>
and tie, and buy a vinyl record —<br>
forgetting<br>
we don’t even own a turntable.<br>
But the record makes a fine decoration.<br>
And then I remember:<br>
she once offered me a turntable<br>
from the heart — and I refused,<br>
thinking I didn’t deserve it.<br>

I went against the grain of novelty,<br>
out of sheer unworthiness.<br>
And when she left,<br>
I started dreaming of her every day<br>
(and every night as well).<br>
I began to feel the longing<br>
I hadn’t felt before;<br>
I tried to be better<br>
than I had ever been.<br>

And life went on,<br>
and novelties kept missing me —<br>
just as is the good custom<br>
of a mediocre life.

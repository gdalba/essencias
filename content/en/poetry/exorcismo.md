Go.<br>
I ask this with everything that still pulses in me:<br>
Go.<br>

Erase your image from the photographs<br>
my memory insists on developing<br>
every night, without my consent.<br>

Undo your voice<br>
from the sentences I repeat<br>
without meaning to.<br>

Tear your presence<br>
from the dreams where you arrive<br>
as if you had never left.<br>

Vanish from my synapses.<br>
Erase your name from my tongue.<br>
Leave the scent of my mornings,<br>
the jolt of my meaningless afternoons.<br>

I beg you, in desperation:<br>
Go.<br>

I want no more of your dream-crumbs,<br>
your outstretched hand,<br>
your belated tenderness,<br>
your performative longing.<br>

Let me live un-haunted.<br>
I exorcise you in poem.<br>
I tear you apart in verse.<br>
I burn you<br>
in the closed eye<br>
of every sleepless night.<br>

Go. Take your dark hair,<br>
your rosy cheeks,<br>
your narrow eyes,<br>
your hopes, your intellect,<br>
your quirks and your laments<br>
and go.<br>

Go.<br>
Take your name in both languages,<br>
and also your lies,<br>
your filthy idealizations of me.<br>

Take your childishness,<br>
your immature hatred of me,<br>
your confused readings of reality,<br>
and your satin catwalks.<br>

Go.<br>
Step back two, three years<br>
and forget me there.<br>
Pretend I never existed.<br>

Go. And let me live the other lives<br>
that were my right.<br>
And go live yours â€”<br>
your better ones.<br>

Go.<br>
Take even what was good.<br>
And disappear.

Say:<br>
Suppose Sara<br>
slips?<br>
She sobs? She silences?<br>
She sighs some sorrow<br>
somewhere,<br>
shadowless?<br>

Soft stories surface:<br>
Sara suffered,<br>
slipped,<br>
survived <br>
scarless, somehow.<br>

Still,<br>
sweet sweat,<br>
salt, signals, smile,<br>
she still surfaces<br>
sans summoning.<br>

So sure:<br>
Sara survives<br>
sleepless, supplicating, shocked.<br>

Somehow,<br>
Sara<br>
stays submissive,<br>
so solemnly she sips silence.<br>

Sunless, structure, sense —<br>
simply smoke,<br>
sentimental scrap,<br>
sans substance.<br>

Sara should sense,<br>
stay still.<br>
See:<br>
sealed secret<br>
stashed<br>
surrounding seven<br>
sentimental<br>
seals.<br>

Suffering,<br>
still soaked,<br>
seeking some shape —<br>
sorrow? Shadow?<br>
Sewer’s soul?<br>

Suppose Sara senses<br>
such sorrow?<br>

Suppose she<br>
sank?<br>

Suppose she<br>
screamed?<br>

Suppose she<br>
surged?<br>

Suppose she<br>
stood?

Suppose she<br>
survived —<br>
solitary?<br>

So sure:<br>
Sara<br>
sails safely<br>
still.<br>

Sara<br>
sits,<br>
silent,<br>
stuck,<br>
staring Southward —<br>
soul sterile,<br>
suffering,<br>
still seeking<br>
some salvation.

In the sky’s glass tank,<br>
my reflection floats, waiting<br>
for the fissure to open<br>
and let everything pour into nothing.<br>

The flasks — small moons —<br>
stand aligned along the horizon’s ledge,<br>
each guarding a handful<br>
of sand stolen from the last shore.<br>

In the universe’s secret chemistry,<br>
I learned to distill a thick silence.<br>
Ah, what a useless science.<br>

I need the wind to find me.<br>
But today, the wind is unbearably cold.<br>
Is this the cosmic sign<br>
that I’ve become<br>
a careless supernova, suspended,<br>
awaiting the death of the universe?<br>

And who would I call to my rescue?<br>
The trunk where the birds sleep?<br>
The stones, precious and unprecious alike?<br>
That face shaped by hundreds of constellations,<br>
still worshipped by humans, gods, and others?<br>

My ethereal friends live in houses of glass,<br>
they could never bear to see me break.<br>
Work is a port in Aldebaran that never existed.<br>
Nothing works. Nothing.<br>

It rains heavily in Aldebaran, sweeping away<br>
the droplets of milk from the Milky Way,<br>
sweeping away the liters of tears<br>
that manifest an ocean<br>
vast in the distant paintings of unnamed galaxies.<br>
The words swim like parasitic worms<br>
feeding on the light.<br>
Better to hasten the undeniable arrival of night.<br>

And so go one, two, three moons,<br>
and the stars go out, one by one,<br>
until my skin dissolves<br>
into atoms, quarks, and whatever lies beyond.<br>

In a leap, seven million years have passed,<br>
and the desert still gnaws the bones<br>
left behind by vultures, and the rains<br>
still wash me from within, and the screams<br>
still drown in the crystalline cleft of the echo<br>
of vegetal existences,<br>
frail and stubborn.<br>

And I manifest. And then I return<br>
everything to the earth and crown it,<br>
and plant one last seed,<br>
fragile, stubbornness,<br>
and wait to see it grow<br>
once again.

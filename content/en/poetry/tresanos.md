At four in the morning.<br>
The calendar — and the clock — look at me with pity,<br>
they say they no longer remember us.<br>

The pillow, aware, sighed<br>
and sheltered the tears that fell in torrents.<br>
The wardrobe still keeps your blouse,<br>
the drawers, your gifts.<br>

Everything — everything has lost your scent,<br>
everything has lost my essence.<br>

The cities have abandoned me, too.<br>
São Paulo offered me a bullet, filled with longing;<br>
I fell already dead into the gutters of the Marginal Tietê.<br>

Paris handed me a live wire of melancholy,<br>
and the smoke from my electrocuted body drew your shape.<br>

The Great Wall of China lives without seeing me,<br>
nor witnessing me jump from it.<br>
Kyiv explodes — a Russian missile finds me,<br>
atomizing so many other lives;<br>
but do I ever care for lives<br>
that aren’t yours?<br>

In Berlin, a pen tipped with cyanide for my heart.<br>
An American spy flees, blending into the innocent elbows<br>
of Germans whose grandfathers once killed each other.<br>

In Moscow, a gang sets me running.<br>
They beat me — and at last they kick my head.<br>
I die watching myself die,<br>
horizontal, the criminals’ feet running, bloodied,<br>
and no one cares.<br>

I see the world spin.<br>
I was beheaded in a mosque in Iran.<br>
I see the sky! I see God!<br>
Strapped to a bomb by the faithful in Afghanistan.<br>

As I fall, a guided missile tears me apart midair —<br>
in Israel, another success of the Iron Dome.<br>

And Swiss submarines launch one or two torpedoes.<br>
What’s left of me is offered to Yemanjá, to the sharks;<br>
I dissolve in open sea.<br>

And how I wish to suffer all that — and more —<br>
for the chance to kiss you in the streets of Xi’an,<br>
to revisit the colors of Tokyo with you,<br>
to kiss your feet along the streets of Vancouver.<br>

Ah, how I wished to defend you from the invisible monsters<br>
I created — and so become a little more of a man<br>
before the vastness that diminishes me<br>
and strips me of the worthiness of your love.<br>

Ah, how I wished to marry you,<br>
to tell you all my dreams,<br>
to live all the loves<br>
that still barely fit inside us.<br>

I wished to die in a thousand ways —<br>
in every country that never knew you —<br>
only to be born again<br>
in the instant you smiled.

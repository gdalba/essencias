## At the Pace of the Starting Line

My awkward, graceless walk<br>
is drawn along the thin line that binds me to painful times<br>
and by the arrogant cerulean abyss<br>
that clouds my future, already soaked in crimson.<br><br>

If I’m headed the wrong way, I’d rather stay aware,<br>
tracing infinite steps across transparent bridges<br>
of uncertainty and doubt — so many, so endlessly flickering —<br>
they echo and distort my destiny.<br><br>

In my melancholic stride that boils within,<br>
I climb the mountains of these invisible peaks.<br>
In fear, there’s no future I can summon<br>
without dying in the void of my intangible gifts.<br><br>

I am not required to remain on this physical plane.<br>
I am a slave to fate — an unfailing predestiny;<br>
layer upon layer of metaphysical reasoning<br>
cut deep into my all-too-tangible flesh.<br><br>

I go, at the pace of the starting line,<br>
in search of a world where I do not exist.<br>
I walk, step by step, into the dawn,<br>
toward the distant mirage in my sight.<br><br>

At the pace of the starting line,<br>
I travel, transcend, dream, and die<br>
with a memory that shall never be refined.<br>
Lying still, to the eternal dream, I cry for help.<br><br>

From here to the pace of my unhappy existence,<br>
hopes bloom and wither in the garden;<br>
a heart impaled upon the fleur-de-lis,<br>
at the starting line of my end.

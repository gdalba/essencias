Let the dead hearts die.<br>
Gather them all and burn them.<br>
Let other hearts be born,<br>
running — but running from what? From whom?<br>
Where do the runaway hearts go?<br>
Do they fall into São Paulo’s gutters?<br>
Do they turn into skewers on Beijing’s corners?<br>
Or do they crash into others,<br>
and in the magic blink of things,<br>
become happy?<br>

Somewhere lives Xiyu’s runaway heart,<br>
and it rains hard along its curves,<br>
acid rains from Aldebaran<br>
fall on the souls of Xi’an.<br>
In some university classroom,<br>
Gabriel’s heart writes its final lecture<br>
and, before them all,<br>
pierces its right atrium with a marker.<br>
Blood gushes, and falls<br>
into the mouths of the stunned students.<br>
God cries hard<br>
in the streets of Betelgeuse.<br>
Venus offers him another man<br>
so he, too, won’t be the chosen one,<br>
but God cries hard —<br>
no one has ever seen him cry so much.<br>
Are these the aberrations of Gabriel,<br>
seeing what he wants<br>
in what does not want him?<br>

The university locks the enrollment<br>
of all its students; the vagrants<br>
who welcomed Xiyu embrace her,<br>
and tell her that idleness will save her —<br>
and she believes them,<br>
and becomes the grandest of vagrants.<br>

And everyone loses.<br>
Everyone, everyone loses.

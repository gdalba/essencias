## Boys and Girls

Boys and girls<br>
play in the yards,<br>
in the streets and gardens.<br>
They cry in their mother’s arms<br>
and plead for more childhood.<br>

Boys and girls<br>
break their toys,<br>
play while broken.<br>
They hear the father’s sermon<br>
and in autumn retreat from loneliness.<br>

Boys and girls<br>
discover themselves and at last<br>
feel longing.<br>

Boys and girls<br>
lost the lap and the sermon<br>
in the shelter of solitude:<br>
they gained bills, broken hearts,<br>
a box of anguish and a drop of depression.<br>

Those who survive now offer mother’s lap,<br>
father’s sermon,<br>
and never stop pleading for more childhood.

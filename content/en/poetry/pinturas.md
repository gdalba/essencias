## Paintings

The silent theater receives<br>
paintings drawn with the finest strokes,<br>
with the most refined and ornate<br>
feeling.<br><br>

A feeling that speaks in silence<br>
to parts of me I had forgotten<br>
even existed.<br><br>

I come across a grey portrait<br>
of a colorful world.<br>
A dark grove within the woodland.<br>
A secret crossed by lies.<br>
A spoken portrait.<br><br>

I come across a colorful portrait<br>
of a dim world,<br>
precious stones amid coal and silt,<br>
a masterpiece.<br>
A faithful self-portrait.<br><br>

My hand dives into the black canvas,<br>
I plunge in my arm, my torso, the weariness<br>
and the shame.<br>
And suddenly, I become a figure in relief<br>
doomed to forever be<br>
a silent painting.

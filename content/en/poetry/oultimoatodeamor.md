It was in the droplets of love,<br>
falling, one from each eye.<br>

It was in restless nights,<br>
in absence, in dreams, in the cold halves.<br>

It was in the first touch of hands,<br>
in the electric clouds that killed us.<br>

It was in the asking for the first kiss,<br>
in the moment eternity believed it existed.<br>

It was on the trip where laughter<br>
still knew how to be born.<br>

It was in the embrace<br>
where the world could fit.<br>

It was in the first fight,<br>
and then, in the first forgiveness.<br>

Or perhaps,<br>
in life’s late forgiveness,<br>
many months after...<br>

when loves were already dead,<br>
and their owners — perhaps — too.<br>

With love, we learn nothing.<br>
I despise the quality this assigns to love,<br>
as something fleeting, enlightening, light.<br>
Love hurts.<br>
Love teaches nothing.<br>
Love is complete unlearning.<br>
It is the undeniable alienation of the human psyche.<br>

From my love, I learned nothing.<br>
I carry it to no one, pass no wisdom on.<br>
From all my mistakes, am I to draw lessons?<br>
I will forget her,<br>
I will turn her into a blur,<br>
murky with forgetting.<br>

I will prove to the world that love yields nothing<br>
but the raw essence of autonomy.<br>
Love is the death of joy.<br>
It is carnal, unnecessary,<br>
and entirely fraudulent.<br>

I learned nothing, absolutely nothing,<br>
from my love. And I will not look back<br>
with the face of wisdom.<br>
Not I, not she, not anyone<br>
has any right to speak of love with wisdom.<br>
What is left to us is only regret,<br>
the lost years that never return,<br>
the aching urge to go back and do it all again,<br>
differently this time,<br>
and to pound the ground in rage<br>
at the impotence with which time punishes us.<br>

Let us celebrate the mistake!<br>
My "love"! My "friends"!<br>
Let us celebrate our incompetence<br>
in making this one life<br>
something beautiful.<br>
So we hide in the caves of Santa Maria,<br>
we beg for other lives, we believe in reincarnation!<br>
But we shall all return as insects, if we return.<br>
And we shall all go to hell, if salvation exists.<br>

And we shall drink colossal doses of alcohol,<br>
and we shall cry in the gutters of forgetfulness,<br>
and we shall, at last, feel alive!<br>

And let them come to me with lessons of love,<br>
with parables of soulmates,<br>
with manuals of overcoming.<br>
Let me tear them with my tongue,<br>
burn them with bile,<br>
silence them with my silence.<br>

For from love I inherited only emptiness,<br>
and a heart that locks itself by instinct â€”<br>
like an animal beaten<br>
who learns to fear affection.<br>
But no, do not say I have learned.<br>
I did not learn. I was mutilated.<br>
I was forgotten. I was unlearned.<br>

And from the depths where I lie,<br>
I shout at the sky and spit upward:<br>
I want no lesson, no redemption, no pretty poem.<br>
I want the right to hate without being healed,<br>
I want the right not to forgive,<br>
not to find meaning,<br>
not to turn this, whatever this is,<br>
into some uplifting ending.<br>

For there is beauty, too, in what rots.<br>
There is a strange aesthetic in failure,<br>
there is glory in failing with honesty,<br>
there is purity in untempered rage,<br>
and solemnity in those who dare to love.<br>

Let us understand ourselves for what we finally are.<br>
We will embrace the insignificance<br>
of that random act<br>
that bundled a handful of atoms<br>
and loosed us into this finite universe<br>
in every one of its axes.<br>

And we shall all be shattered by the inconstancies of life.<br>
And we shall all be stretched on the rack of spacetime.<br>
And we shall all be betrayed by our lovers, if we do not betray them first.<br>
And we shall all be forgotten by others, and by things.<br>
And we shall all be unhappy, cursed, and unhappy.<br>
And we shall all be errors of this universe.<br>
And we shall all be.<br>
And we shall be.<br>

Let us, then, celebrate the coming of peace of death,<br>
the celebration of life<br>
as a sequence of mistakes,<br>
avoidable,<br>
and inevitably irreversible.<br>

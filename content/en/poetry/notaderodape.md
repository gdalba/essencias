summary: "Infallibly, entropy swallows us."
---

The natural order of things dictates<br>
that first we come close,<br>
then we fall in love,<br>
and then, categorically,<br>
we begin to drift apart.<br>

Things — they slip away at an angle<br>
infallibly, entropy swallows us<br>
entirely. Loves begin to slip<br>
through the cellular membranes of life,<br>
and what remains are the decayed proteins<br>
of mundane existence,<br>
inside the nucleus, the core,<br>
encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid.<br>

And thus, love is explained<br>
in Gabriel’s universe:<br>
a biochemical process of high beauty,<br>
with an emotionally unstable half-life,<br>
whose decay affects all vital functions —<br>
his and others’.<br>
And when it finally dies,<br>
as things do die,<br>
the capacity to write<br>
molecular verses is reborn.<br>

In this universe, there is experimental error,<br>
systemic failures of the system,<br>
the inevitability of drifting apart,<br>
the entropy of affection,<br>
the cellular death caused by a peptide aberration<br>
between two once-complicit molecules.<br>

And photons travel from the farthest stars,<br>
and excite other molecules, and they draw near,<br>
but in Gabriel, disadvantageous<br>
mutations arise.<br>
Natural selection eventually removes him,<br>
and what remains are the others —<br>
the more successful<br>
randomnesses of this life.<br>

The universe, reading the report,<br>
signed the footnote in silence<br>
and kept on spinning.

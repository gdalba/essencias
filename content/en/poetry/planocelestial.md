## Heavenly Plane

In the half-light, the road ahead narrows me into a horizon.<br>
Barefoot, I step on sharp cobblestones,<br>
rainwater runs in gutters, grass grows over the sidewalks,<br>
and a horizon lies ahead, without a single light.<br>
Within me grows a need,<br>
a longing so honed it hovers above me<br>
and makes me walk and walk and walk:<br>
I know there is an end to this road,<br>
and I know I want to reach it.<br>
To my left, Giovanni walks, arm in arm with his beloved.<br>
To my right, shadows elbow through,<br>
in tattered clothes, reeking of death, but still walking.<br>
And suddenly, in a breath that rips through time’s fabric,<br>
what was once a shapeless horizon now bursts into infinite forms,<br>
and my eyes are flooded by magnificent trees<br>
radiating the landscape with singular grace.<br>
Far ahead, an arch draws in the thousands of souls who walked with me.<br>
Now I understand we all walk toward a single destiny<br>
there is a gate between the smoky plain and a heavenly plane.<br>
One step through, and the grime of my body vanishes<br>
(the impurities of the soul stored in a bottomless box).<br>
The half-light recoils in shame before this crystal-clear day;<br>
trees spill into a thousand forests, overflowing my gaze;<br>
streams run upward and down; mountains and stairways fill with people.<br>
I climb fifteen steps and there are my aunts, Ana and Tônia,<br>
chatting endlessly.<br>
I see Uncle Alexandre passing by, handing out chocolates<br>
with a hopeful smile, prosperous<br>
like a breath of life in the air.<br>
My mother comes to greet me, that caring mother who said goodbye<br>
not too late,<br>
and now receives me again, warmly,<br>
the way only a mother’s arms can truly do.<br>
All around, thousands of people, millions of hearts.<br>
With every moment, decayed bodies cross the celestial gate,<br>
and are slowly refined<br>
until only their most human essence remains<br>
incorruptible by the vices of the earthly realm.<br>
They go to meet their families, their children;<br>
they go receive chocolate from my uncle;<br>
they go to see smiles<br>
and to be happy.<br>
At the entrance, my Uncle Geraldo comes in too,<br>
hands behind his back, eyes lowered,<br>
the gaze of someone who suffered much in life,<br>
unable to free himself from the chains<br>
which no longer exist here.<br>
Further on, the horizon swells into a field of golden grass.<br>
There in the middle, the sower of sunflowers tends to his delicate forest of asteraceae,<br>
wearing a hat, forever youthful.<br>
There, he transforms the landscape<br>
and he is happy.<br>
Happy as I am too,<br>
happy as I never was.<br>
Until suddenly, a torment rises in my chest.<br>
I remember there is a void inside me,<br>
and I desperately search for my dear brother.<br>
I spin around myself, in despair,<br>
and drown in the agony of the condemned.<br>
I scream, I run, I feel the tears fall,<br>
I cry, howl, strike, fall, die,<br>
I push away the pure souls who block my return<br>
down the dark path I came from,<br>
to fetch him, to find him, to bring him back here,<br>
to finally see him walk, to hear all he never could say,<br>
to see his smile a million more times,<br>
to see his serene face shine like a beacon in my life.<br>
Then the truth finally touches me,<br>
and so the tears stop,<br>
and my despair is overtaken by a feeling of eternal gratitude:<br>
When I look, feel, and pulse within this heavenly plane<br>
I look at my brother.<br>

The day breaks with the weight of all the years.<br>
The hours remember the calendar,<br>
the calendar remembers you.<br>

Twelve days since the first,<br>
twelve hugs, twelve kisses,<br>
twelve seasons passing in the same instant,<br>
twelve manifestations of the twelfth day.<br>

Twelve celebrations,<br>
one special in the twelfth month<br>
minus two. Twelve days later<br>
minus one, it is your birthday.<br>

But today, silence<br>
is the only guest.<br>
It sits across from me,<br>
drinks from my coffee,<br>
mocks my plans to make you happy,<br>
laughs at the times I tried to love you,<br>
and cackles, cruel,<br>
at the sorrow of having lost you.<br>

I keep, in the twelfths,<br>
the scraps of conversations,<br>
the smiles cut short,<br>
the touches that still reach me,<br>
even if ghostlike.<br>

And I think: if there were<br>
twelve drops of poison,<br>
perhaps the twelfth day would evaporate<br>
and fall, like me,<br>
into nothing.

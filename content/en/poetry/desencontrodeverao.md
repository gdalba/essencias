## Summer Mismeeting

It’s the summer of twenty twenty-two,<br>
and we missed each other.<br>
Partners? We were never partners.<br>
We were clumsy and unfortunate enough<br>
to find each other<br>
and fool each other<br>
for a handful of time that won’t return.<br>

And I, in my pettiness and foolishness,<br>
took from you what was most precious.<br>
And I, in my loneliness and insecurity,<br>
took your reins and made you a pack animal,<br>
to carry the weight of my soul<br>
and sink into the mud of lives poorly lived.<br>

This isn’t romance. It isn’t drama.<br>
It doesn’t fit in matinees,<br>
or in Vancouver bookstores.<br>
It has no happy ending. It isn’t the *Before* trilogy.<br>
It’s not minimalist. it’s absurd, it’s unreal.<br>
It’s error a thousand times over, and error is what it is.<br>

It’s a summer mismeeting,<br>
a mismeeting of people and their things.<br>
And those things are petty and foul.<br>
And those people are petty and foul.<br>
And you are foul. Your soul is foul.<br>
And I am worse. My soul is worse.<br>
And after writing this, I cry so much.<br>
My soul cries so much.<br>
The tears slide across the floor of apartment 708.<br>

The neighbors below complain loudly,<br>
then, more quietly, feel sorry for me.<br>
And you,  do you feel sorry for me?<br>
I do. I feel terribly sorry for you.<br>

I hope the bile of life slowly spoils,<br>
and that the body I inhabit withers with it.<br>
And that no one ever pities me again.<br>
And that I never again pity anyone.<br>
And that I never again pity you.

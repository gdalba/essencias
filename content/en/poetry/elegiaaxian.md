"(S)He was my North, my South, my East and West"<br>
-Funeral Blues, W. H. Auden.<br>


Close the clocks, conceal the calendars.<br>
Let monotony reign in endless days,<br>
let mourning settle in the silence<br>
of halted hours.<br>

She is gone.<br>
And, heaven forgive me,<br>
I wish it were death<br>
that took her from me,<br>
not this nameless absence.<br>
What was once eternal<br>
crumbled into dust.<br>

Coffins are carried on buses and planes,<br>
yet in Xi’an life never paused.<br>
The flowers I planted died unnoticed.<br>
And those who see me<br>
offer condolences too heavy for their mouths.<br>

Extinguish the stars from the night,<br>
lock the moon in her stone chest,<br>
banish the sun from his throne.<br>
For winter has come, unyielding,<br>
and a snow of ashes<br>
spreads across the earth.<br>

We walk upon this snow,<br>
our traces vanish.<br>
Fragments of memory die,<br>
feelings die,<br>
the organs follow, one by one.<br>

Yesterday it was the liver.<br>
The day before, the left lung.<br>
The right one shall follow.<br>
The brain already vegetates.<br>
And the heart, last sentinel,<br>
watches everything until the end,<br>
until the lights of the cosmos are extinguished,<br>
until the gods are torn<br>
from their heavens.<br>

And I shall depart.<br>

While in Xi’an<br>
you will go on living,<br>
never knowing<br>
that I have died.

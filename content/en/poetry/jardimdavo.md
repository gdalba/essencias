## Grandma’s Garden

Abstract birds<br>
among uniform trees.<br>
Feelings picked from the apple tree;<br>
my tears resting in Mother Earth’s lap.<br>

Tiny red flowers sprouting in spring,<br>
I, muddied from so much imagining <br>
and falling, and hurting myself<br>
on the clean lands of childhood.<br>

Those were light times, those were good times,<br>
and they simply were.

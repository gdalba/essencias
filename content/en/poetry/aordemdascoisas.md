Gabriel, drinking from the fountain of love, imagined<br>
dying hand in hand with Sara,<br>
of old age, dying of longing.<br>
In that one millisecond without her,<br>
without Sara, he died, in utter solitude.<br>

Today, her future is all bright lights. His is disarray.<br>
Poor Gabriel, that sad old fool, he’ll die alone one day.<br>
And so, he thinks it’s wise to keep the windows open wide,<br>
so the stench of the dead might bring the neighbors to his side.<br>

You will bury your parents,<br>
and you will cry over the natural order of things.<br>
And you will ask: is that the most useless of all cries?<br>
The cry over the natural order of things?<br>
But why does the natural order of things hurt so much?<br>

Maybe it would be better to cry over dying without Sara.<br>
She won’t cry for Gabriel either.<br>
And perhaps crying over other things<br>
has some sentimental value.<br>

But Sara will die with someone else, someday,<br>
and he will mourn that one second<br>
that was meant to be Gabriel’s.<br>

Perhaps that is life’s ultimate blessing:<br>
to die alone, Gabriel, without bothering anyone<br>
and let the others deal with it.<br>

That is Gabriel’s natural order.

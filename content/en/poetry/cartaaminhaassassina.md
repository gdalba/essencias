Dear murderer,<br>
I have been sentenced by you to a death<br>
that will last the next forty years,<br>
or less. Because of this, I was overtaken<br>
by an uncontrollable rage,<br>
and wished to hasten all the suffering<br>
in the moment that just passed.<br>
I wrote verses consumed by a hatred<br>
unceasing toward your existence.<br>
But not even to hatred do I lend myself.<br>
And so, I wished you<br>
far less than the torment I bear.<br>
On the contrary, now I see myself<br>
whole, standing before my sentence,<br>
disproportionate though it may be.<br>
Yet to you, I wish a fate<br>
unlike mine.<br>
For I shall depart this physical form,<br>
sooner or later,<br>
and with me shall perish<br>
the songs I never sang<br>
and those I once sang<br>
for you. So may your sentence<br>
be light, and not as cursed
as mine. May your hand never again<br>
condemn another to such absolute failure.<br>
I hope your mornings are not broken<br>
by an unshakable gust of sorrow.<br>
I hope your dreams are not stolen
by a preordained chain of nightmares
and suffering.<br>
And on your happiest days,<br>
may you never feel the bitter longing<br>
to tell me you are happy.<br>
May silence not suffocate you.<br>
May your loves be true loves.<br>
May your blessings be loyal<br>
to the highest divine praise.<br>
May your family never mourn<br>
a lifeless body, unlike mine.<br>
May you do good in this life,<br>
and become unforgettable<br>
as you were to me.<br>
May time prove you were always right.<br>
May I have been an accident.<br>
And may the universe never again reproduce<br>
its systematic errors in someone like me.<br>
Amen.

Hand lost in space-time,<br>
cries and laments in the eternal void,<br>
hours so called by convention,<br>
minutes and seconds going back and forth<br>
against<br>
destiny.<br>

Hand I stare at tirelessly,<br>
I lose hours and I lose days and I lose months and I lose years,<br>
and nothing from this hand announces what I need.<br>

Hand that moves independently<br>
from my cowardly attempts.<br>
Deceitful hand, it stopped, and with it<br>
I stopped.<br>

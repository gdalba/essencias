In the psychoanalyst’s office<br>
I’m being analyzed by five aliens<br>
inside their spaceship<br>
of most magnificent nothingness.<br>

The alien with the mustache takes notes,<br>
scholarly notes, catechistic notes,<br>
in melodramatic ink,<br>
and with religious precision<br>
he psychoanalyzes me.<br>

Specimen: humanoid.<br>
Stature: pathetic.<br>
Beauty: nonexistent.<br>
Intelligence: nearly null.<br>

Presents delusions of grandeur<br>
based on poems and minor memory distortions.<br>
Wanders inside hallucinations<br>
he himself wrote with absurd metaphors<br>
and war vocabulary.<br>

Thinks, often, that he is at war.<br>
And worse —<br>
writes about it.<br>

Diagnosis:<br>
Poetry: feigns grandeur<br>
to describe a misery<br>
and in the attempt,<br>
the misery gains real grandeur.<br>

Patient is unstable<br>
but functional<br>
for now.<br>

Returnable to his little planet,<br>
just one more solar system,<br>
just one of eight billion,<br>
or whatever math feels like saying these days.<br>

In the bathtub, my body floats.<br>
I wait, with the patience of the drowned,<br>
for the tragedy to take the trouble to arrive.<br>

The pill bottles,<br>
all counted, all lined up,<br>
a private exercise of alchemy.<br>

In the alchemy of depression,<br>
I forged the antidote to suffering.<br>
Ah, such useless wisdom.<br>

I need help. Now.<br>
God, the water is so cold. Why?<br>
I opened the faucet in the fever of midday sun.<br>
Could it be I’m already dead<br>
and this is nothing more<br>
than a bureaucratic formality?<br>

But who to call for help?<br>
My parents? The most heinous crime.<br>
My brother? That would corrupt what is pure.<br>
Her? She’s the one who brought me here.<br>
Perhaps she’d hand me the pills herself,<br>
force them down my throat,<br>
drown me, electrocute me,<br>
buy the coffin, seal it with seventy thousand locks,<br>
and throw it, weighed with two hundred tons,<br>
into the Mariana Trench.<br>

Friends? I will not scar them.<br>
Unemployment? Materialism of the nonexistent.<br>
Nothing works, God. Nothing works.<br>

The Bible fell in the water.<br>
The letters are swimming.<br>
I can’t read Your teachings.<br>
Better hurry.<br>

And so one, two, three bottles go.<br>
My body dissolves in the tears of the Milky Way.<br>
In a gasp, I see myself seven years on.<br>
Nothing has changed:<br>
misery still gnaws at my edges,<br>
the tears still fall,<br>
the sobs and screams and shouts<br>
are swallowed by the vacuum<br>
of my stupid, incompetent existence.<br>

But it is mine.<br>

So I vomit it all back up and consecrate<br>
my pathetic incompetence<br>
once again.

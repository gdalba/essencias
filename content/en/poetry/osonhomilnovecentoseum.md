I dreamed of you again.<br>
The twentieth time<br>
just this month<br>
(and it’s only the eighth day).<br>

This damned time,<br>
we were in an open field,<br>
surrounded by linen napkins,<br>
elbowed between fine glass cups<br>
and small servings<br>
in porcelain bowls.<br>

We laughed.<br>
We sampled exotic sauces<br>
and very strange herbs,<br>
dishes from China and Brazil<br>
from some other universe.<br>

You said to me:<br>
“this one tastes like the time<br>
you hurt me.”<br>
And I laughed. I answered,<br>
“set it aside,<br>
and try this one —<br>
it’s the flavor of tomorrow’s love.”<br>
And, for a moment,<br>
I was happy with rage.<br>

Then the crowd came.<br>
People I don’t know.<br>
People who don’t matter.<br>
Too many people.<br>

And you were taken.<br>
Elbowed away by the shadows of the crowd,<br>
as if you had never been there at all.<br>

Why?<br>
Why do even dreams give in to you?<br>
Why does even delirium<br>
recreate you in my brain?<br>
Why won’t you leave —<br>
not even my synapses?<br>

Such hatred.<br>
Hatred of dreaming.<br>
Hatred of you,<br>
of your absurd persistence.<br>
Of your hidden signature<br>
in every corner<br>
of my unconscious.<br>

I just want to sleep<br>
and not find you in laughter.<br>
Not in the field.<br>
Not in the wine.<br>
Not in anything.

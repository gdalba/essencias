## I no longer see the difference between sleeping and dying

I no longer see the difference between sleeping and dying.<br>
There are no shades of gray left in my sea of darkness.<br>

I no longer hope that happiness might one day bind me,<br>
nor that life will outweigh the reveries that punish me.<br>

Enduring are the shadows that follow my path,<br>
haunting are the scars of a past so grim,<br>
uncertain are the laments of a future so cold.<br>

I no longer paint upon the canvas of my life.<br>
So ugly it is, the product of a failure,<br>
dead in the sleep of the past.

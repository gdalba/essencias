You wanted me the way one wants a remedy<br>
for an illness with no name.<br>
You wanted my laughter<br>
to feed your silences,<br>
my plans<br>
to cover your voids.<br>

You wanted my certainties<br>
to hush your doubts.<br>
And when I wasn’t a cure —<br>
when I was just a person —<br>
you called me boring.<br>

And so I remained,<br>
marked on the skin<br>
with the cold iron of dishonest loves,<br>
the kind that say “I love you”<br>
before knowing what it costs.<br>

There is a theory about parasitic love,<br>
and it bears your name.<br>
Your name, your form,<br>
your slightly melancholic thoughts.<br>

They are loves that survive on<br>
the love of others.<br>
They suck the pulp, spit out the seed<br>
of the only fruit the other carries.<br>
That fruit God handed out saying:<br>
“take this and deal with it.<br>
if it spoils, tough.<br>
if it lasts, I’ll fix it tomorrow.”<br>

You, in theory, loved me<br>
up until the moment I needed love.<br>
Then, you got tired.<br>

And still —<br>
in the deep foolishness of the parasitized —<br>
I beg you in dreams to stay.<br>

Still,<br>
I blame myself<br>
for not having entertained you enough.<br>
For not being many.<br>
For not being someone else,<br>
or else,<br>
or else,<br>
or else.<br>

And maybe that’s my illness.<br>
Or just another Tuesday<br>
in which I dream again<br>
of my favorite parasite.

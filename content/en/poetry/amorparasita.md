You desired me as a cure for an incurable disease.<br>
You wanted my laughter to devour your silences.<br>
You wanted my plans to line the walls of your emptiness.<br>
You wanted my certainties to quiet your doubts.<br>
But when I was neither cure nor source of laughter,<br>
and neither planned nor struck true,<br>
you called me a pitiful boredom.<br>

Thus I was marked,<br>
skin seared by the cold iron of lying loves,<br>
and, in the desperation of madness, I forged the theory of parasitic loves,<br>
and I gave it your name,<br>
your name, your shape,<br>
your slightly sad thoughts.<br>

The theory states that parasites are loves<br>
that live off anotherâ€™s love.<br>
That kill, cruelly, even the image of God.<br>
That feed, and leave, and sometimes starve,<br>
and beg for another victim.<br>
And you, who in theory loved me,<br>
vomited when I needed love.<br>

Then, you grew tired.<br>

And still, in the deep foolishness of the parasitized,<br>
I beg you, in dreams, in sobs and prayers, to stay.<br>
And still I blame myself for not having fed you enough.<br>
For not having been many. For not having been another,<br>
or another, or another, or another.<br>

And perhaps that is my illness.<br>
Or just another Tuesday<br>
when I dreamed again<br>
of my favorite parasite.

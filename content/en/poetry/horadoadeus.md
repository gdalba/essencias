It’s time to say goodbye.<br>
And burn everything that ever belonged to your heart.<br>
The fire burns so bright,<br>
it rivals the light at the end of my life.<br>

And suddenly,<br>
a forgotten corner of my pants catches fire.<br>
And suddenly,<br>
all of me is burning.<br>

The smell of human brisket fills the room,<br>
and I am dying an agonizing death.<br>

And these flames of hatred —<br>
oh, how they burn!<br>
They burn the memory<br>
of the time I held your hand.<br>

My eyes melt into mirrors<br>
where you still kiss me — endlessly.<br>
The sunflowers in my heart catch fire,<br>
and my throat will never speak of love again,<br>
its cords burned to a crisp.<br>

It hurts one last time —<br>
such is the price<br>
of saying goodbye.<br>

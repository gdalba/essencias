To love, first<br>
one must be born.<br>

Then, everything must conspire:<br>
the footsteps of your father,<br>
the hesitations of your mother,<br>
the sadness of your brother,<br>
the doors that opened too early,<br>
the windows that closed too late,<br>
and this train of life which,<br>
with its chaotic punctuality,<br>
delivered me to you.<br>

So, to love,<br>
I thank the first atom<br>
that knew how to hold itself together,<br>
the whispering hum of galaxies,<br>
the wind that carried your voice to my ears.<br>

And before atoms,<br>
before galaxies,<br>
before the wind,<br>
I thank God.<br>

To love you<br>
is to turn words<br>
into a craft of prayer.

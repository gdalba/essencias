Do you manifest in my dreams for what reason?<br>
I firmly deny it is the randomness of things<br>
that brings you to my mind<br>
with such frequency – no, with such consistency!<br>
Would it be divine penance for not having treated you well?<br>
And if I did treat you well? And still life<br>
chose to take me from you and you from me? And if I was the one mistreated?<br>
To what purpose serves the punishment of dreams?<br>
The truth is I love you, and I always will,<br>
and I will go on dreaming out of sheer stubbornness:<br>
for my life is the constant state of memory<br>
of the things that were ours: of your poses<br>
when I gazed at you, of your scent<br>
before and after the baths, of the shape<br>
of your things, of the way you looked at me<br>
from the window of your apartment, the way<br>
you opened the door to receive me with a kiss,<br>
sometimes only with an embrace, sometimes<br>
with playful reverences, of the tones<br>
of your laughter, and the way you sang,<br>
and the ways you kissed, and the ways<br>
you loved, and the foods you liked,<br>
and the clothes you wore, and the dreams<br>
you left behind just to make room for me<br>
in your soul so beautiful, and how you would manifest<br>
in my dreams nonetheless, and how my longing<br>
percolated the fabric of everyday life, and how you carried yourself<br>
on our birthdays, and how you behaved<br>
when I hurt you, and how you denied me<br>
the word when I offended you, and how you gave me<br>
the world when you loved me.<br>
To dream of you<br>
lies far away from the reasonable world of explanations,<br>
I dream because I love you<br>
and forever I will love, and dream, and weep.

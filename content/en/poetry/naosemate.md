Please, please, don’t kill yourself!<br>
Tomorrow, that unknown day,<br>
hides within life. You might win<br>
a million tomorrow, or you might die<br>
in an even worse way. So today,<br>
don’t kill yourself, Gabriel, don’t kill yourself!<br>

Tomorrow she returns, she must return,<br>
your dream told you so, didn’t it?<br>
And would you need a greater reason than that?<br>
Then don’t kill yourself, Gabriel, please,<br>
don't kill yourself.<br>

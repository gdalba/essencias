## Reverie
In reverie, I realize I am dying.<br>
I realize they treat me like I'm sick.<br>
That they see me as condemned,<br>
and there's a sorrowful aura hanging over my ugly body.<br>

Gazes lament my imperfections.<br>
The mirror, ashamed, hesitates to reflect me.<br>
My body shows signs of no longer wanting to exist.<br>

And I am dying.<br>

I hear music torment my frail ears.<br>
I see others dancing with staggering joy<br>
while I reduce myself to the dance of a funeral rhythm,<br>
marching, ill-fated, toward my coffin’s end.<br>

They paint my portrait in blood-red hues,<br>
they crush my hopes with perverse precision,<br>
turning the painting of my life<br>
into the brutal scene of a crime of vengeance.<br>

I am dying, but I didn’t want to die.<br>
I am yearning, though I shouldn’t yearn.<br>
I am crying, when I should be dying.<br>

Even more now, on the brink of sleep.<br>
Little will be worth all that I still desire.<br>
Little will be worth all that I have lost.<br>
Hope is of no use to me<br>
if, like a child’s dream,<br>
it is taken away from me.<br>

Mother, this bed is so cold,<br>
it echoes my breath in such a sinister tone<br>
and declares that my companions<br>
will be worms and parasites.<br>

Lie with me, mother.<br>
Don’t leave me crying alone.<br>
I am dying, but I am afraid.<br>
Afraid to realize I could have lived,<br>
and that now it’s too late.<br>
That I didn’t die<br>
but killed myself.<br>

Lie with me, my friend,<br>
my beloved death.<br>
Ignore the grey flesh that sustains me<br>
and warm me with your sweet kiss.<br>
Make me sleep — but sleep beside me.<br>

I lived so alone, death.<br>
I tried so hard to love.<br>
But my love is worse than your coming.<br>
I flirted with souls so beautiful<br>
that they wished for you more than for me.<br>

So I now flirt with you, and beg:<br>
seduce me and take me to nothingness.<br>
Or wait for me — I’ll come to meet you,<br>
dragging these frail legs<br>
that can bear neither the weight of my tears<br>
nor the weight of my pain.<br>

Enter, close the door, my love.<br>
Ignore this caricature of defeat,<br>
this fool without reason.<br>
Just behold your greatest work.<br>
Free me, death.<br>
I’m ready to go.<br>

Do, by your means,<br>
the most beautiful act the world has ever seen.<br>

And the door closes.<br>

But not even you, death,<br>
lay down with me.<br>

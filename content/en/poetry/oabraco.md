Sometimes God takes away my poetry.<br>
I see a stone — I can only see a stone.<br>

A sweet girl prays facing Mecca;<br>
by evening she sells ice cream to Canadians,<br>
grateful for the kindness of strangers.<br>

Another reads the English classics,<br>
and when she lifts her eyes, she sees children running<br>
through the parks of some city in China.<br>
It’s her favorite place to read.<br>

Another girl hides in the corner of her living room,<br>
and laughs, remembering the throne of books<br>
in her castle of books —<br>
safe from this world.<br>

A maple leaf fell close to my chest,<br>
and the impact, instead of hurting, flowed<br>
like the tears that run through Vancouver.<br>

It rains a lot in Vancouver.<br>
Saint Peter pours his sorrow upon us,<br>
and not every tear is sadness.<br>

So many leaves fall around me,<br>
and not all of them embrace me.<br>
I have lived a life without embraces.<br>

I have lived a life without a kiss.<br>
Many lives are lived without a kiss,<br>
many lives are lived without an embrace.<br>

In such hours, Saint Peter weeps with sorrow.<br>
But today, a maple leaf fell close to my chest,<br>
and at once I felt her embrace.<br>

The tears that fell — were of joy.<br>
They ran through the streets of Vancouver.<br>
The maple leaf slid down my chest,<br>
and in it, I felt embraced.<br>

Sometimes God gives me back my poetry.<br>
I see a leaf — and feel her embrace.

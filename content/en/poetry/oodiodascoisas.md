## The Hatred of Things

To those who hate the most mundane things,<br>
I understand them.<br>
I too hate the things,<br> 
all things.<br>

I hate my voice.<br>
Its echo shivers down my spine.<br>
I hate my mind,<br>
with its impure thoughts,<br>
schizophrenic, often cursed.<br>
I hate my eyes<br>
and their inability to see,<br>
in the world,<br>
a place not full of hate for things.<br>

I hate the streets scrubbed clean on boring Sundays.<br>
I hate the shine of storefronts that never want me.<br>
I hate the precise ticking of the clock<br>
as if time had the right to go on.<br>

I hate the peace sold on billboards,<br>
the toothpaste smiles,<br>
the softness of sheets that never hold me,<br>
the doorknobs that turn<br>
into empty rooms.<br>

But most of all, I hate hate<br>
for it makes me write.<br>
And in writing, I love.<br>
And loving, I forgive.<br>
And forgiving,<br>
I become the very thing I despise:<br>
a thing.<br>
among things.<br>
of things.<br>

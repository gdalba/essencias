## Sacristy Painting

To the east of the pontifical archway, God and I lie asleep.<br>
On the staircase to the west: a pagan, with a tormented gaze, watches me and knows<br>
that I am fated for the chest the devil guards under seven locks<br>
in the shack by a red lake,<br>
stained with the spilled blood of my mother,<br>
who, in the death of birthing me into the world,<br>
understood the world to be fleeting—<br>
a crystal with sharp edges, a prism of many facets.<br><br>

It will ache in my heart when I remember who died for me,<br>
it will ache in my soul when I reveal my ingratitude.<br>
But this world is not worth much to me,<br>
and there is little in this world<br>
that is worth as much as the love<br>
of the one who died for me.

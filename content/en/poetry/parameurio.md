I dreamed we were showering together,<br>
and you were so beautiful I stopped just to admire you.<br>
And I admired you so long, so long, so long<br>
that I lost all sense of time<br>
and saw you spilling into the falling water.<br>

And you began dissolving, dissolving, dissolving,<br>
until neither shape nor memory remained.<br>
You became a river outright, converging<br>
in your curves, your eddies, your quiet dances,<br>
crying to me like a child<br>
with my little ribbons of satin.<br>

I grew desperate — so, so desperate —<br>
and tried to hold you, to gather you in my arms,<br>
thinking that if I kept you close enough,<br>
you might not disappear.<br>

But I embraced the water and slipped.<br>
Hit my head, passed out,<br>
and bled, and bled, and bled,<br>
until I died.<br>

My blood was carried by the river,<br>
carried my loves, my griefs,<br>
and my will to live.<br>

Then I woke up.

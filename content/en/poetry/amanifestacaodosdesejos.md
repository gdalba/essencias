I dreamed of you, Sara,<br>
once again.<br>
This time, in an invented August,<br>
when your birthday<br>
decided to arrive ahead of time.<br>

A woman, friend, angel in disguise,<br>
called me to your party.<br>
I, a boy of urgencies<br>
and despairs, ran through the world’s shop windows:<br>
jewels, perfumes, flowers, stuffed animals,<br>
everything that might cover the silence<br>
and give form to my desires<br>
for you.<br>

But as if God himself wished to warn me<br>
that I am still destined to punishment,<br>
fate, ironic, whispered back:<br>
you do not want my presence.<br>
I accepted the message with the resignation<br>
of one who already knew — and should have known.<br>
So I wrapped the gifts<br>
and laid down this longing<br>
once more.<br>

Then Tiago arrived,<br>
companion of heavy hours,<br>
and with the angel<br>
led me to the kitchen of my house,<br>
stage of other dreams with you, too.<br>

And there, you were,<br>
with braids and your absolutely perfect smile,<br>
with the full brightness<br>
of a face I only allow myself<br>
the luxury of seeing in dreams.<br>

You opened your arms<br>
and gathered me against your chest.<br>
Ah, my beloved,<br>
how I wept in that embrace!<br>
I wept without shame,<br>
I wept as though emerging from the womb,<br>
I wept the most honest and desperate cry<br>
that love can give.<br>

And such was the intensity that I awoke,<br>
and, guess what,<br>
I wept.

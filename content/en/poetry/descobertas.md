Discoveries are made every day.<br>
In some, we reinvent ourselves.<br>
We see the sunlit mornings of Beijing,<br>
and in others —<br>
the hush of the dead,<br>
the graveyards of things and their objects<br>
that belong to no one anymore.<br>
To whom do they belong, then?<br>
Who owns what no longer has an owner?<br>

I discovered I had aged<br>
the day I stopped imagining clouds<br>
as battle cruisers<br>
carrying heroes from distant galaxies<br>
coming to Earth<br>
to fight their ancient foes<br>
before my wide, believing eyes.<br>

Now I just see clouds.<br>
They haven’t lost their beauty —<br>
it’s not mine to take or grant —<br>
but I only see the passing of life,<br>
the wind that pushes them forward,<br>
and nothing more.<br>
They are that, and nothing more.<br>
And what remains,<br>
if it is just that and nothing more?<br>

The world is beautiful,<br>
but I have grown old.<br>
And sometimes, it unsettles me<br>
that the world won’t die with me.<br>
That I’m far more temporary.<br>
And sometimes<br>
I wonder if the world, too,<br>
feels uncertain<br>
in the face of the universe.<br>

And perhaps the universe itself<br>
feels small<br>
before the many others.<br>
Perhaps it fears death,<br>
the end of all things.<br>
Or perhaps nothing ends,<br>
perhaps all is beginning again,<br>
and I should seek<br>
my own beginning, too?<br>

But today I am too old.<br>
Clouds are just clouds.<br>
Love is no longer love,<br>
just psycho-chemical reactions.<br>
The birds in the sky go on strutting.<br>
The wind keeps pushing them.<br>
And life continues.<br>
And the universes die<br>
inside each one of us.<br>

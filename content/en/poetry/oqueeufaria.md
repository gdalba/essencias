What would I do with all the tears I’ve shed:<br>
the ones I cried for having hurt you,<br>
the ones that came from seeing you so beautiful,<br>
the ones I poured while pouring love into you,<br>
the ones that slipped out<br>
just thinking of you on some stray afternoon,<br>
the ones that welled up<br>
hearing the songs you chose for me,<br>
the ones I cried for being, beside you, so happy.<br>

if I could take them all back now,<br>
what would I do with them?<br>
For whom, or for what, or where<br>
would I let them fall?

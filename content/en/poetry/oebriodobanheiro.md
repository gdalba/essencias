Gentlemen!<br>
I ask for silence in this sacred dump.<br>
Not to pray —<br>
I’m here to scream a damned memory<br>
that won’t leave my chest even after three shots<br>
and half a liter of forgetfulness!<br>

Why — Oh, tell me why! —<br>
why didn’t I hold her that night?<br>
That night of all nights!<br>
Yes, she came back!<br>
She came back one last time!<br>
She had those… those eyes of forgiveness,<br>
though already so tired,<br>
those tiny hands of redemption.<br>

Not even that cursed smile<br>
that once taught me to love<br>
and condemned me to hunger<br>
was on her lips.<br>

I, gentlemen — miserable!<br>
Ah! What a miserable wreck I was! —<br>
lay on the bathroom floor!<br>
Yes, fallen like a stray dog,<br>
pathetic as I always was!<br>

And she came to fetch me from the abyss<br>
with a gesture,<br>
mute, defeated too,<br>
with that kind of presence<br>
that only the wretched know how to recognize!<br>

And me... I,<br>
who had the so-called knife and butter in my hands,<br>
I, who thought I would be<br>
the most wonderful lover in the known universe<br>
for being "not like the others,"<br>
I...<br>
I didn’t go.<br>
I trembled.<br>
I trembled so much.<br>

My friends! I stayed silent!!!!<br>
And so, gentlemen —<br>
so I lost the last chance that was given to me!<br>

And today, oh drunken heavens,<br>
I relive that scene like a convict relives his crime!<br>
Schizophrenia gnaws at the guts of my mind.<br>
Too many voices now,<br>
eyes on the walls,<br>
the shaking,<br>
the uncontrollable gestures,<br>
the screams, the howls,<br>
the enormous sobbing.<br>

The cold tile,<br>
the crooked mirror reflection,<br>
the dripping faucet,<br>
the machines in the ceiling,<br>
a clock that mocks me without mercy!<br>

Why, tell me,<br>
why does this woman — this venom<br>
with a first and last name<br>
in two languages, no less, two! —<br>
still parasite my dreams?<br>

Why won’t she let me live,<br>
drink,<br>
or die in peace?<br>

I call her a parasite, yes!<br>
But ah!<br>
If she walked through that filthy door right now,<br>
and said,<br>
“I’m here. Now go.”<br>
— I would love to go.<br>
I, the fool, would love to go.<br>

But now I am far too sick<br>
for such foolish things.<br>

So let’s drink.<br>
That was it.<br>
Thank you very much.

My neighbor still wonders<br>
where her friend was taken<br>
on that ruined afternoon<br>
of sixty-four.<br>

It is a question<br>
honest and silent<br>
in forbidden times.<br>

The friend disappeared,<br>
and with her, hope died.<br>
Death passed by<br>
wearing its uniform.<br>

(And still, there are those<br>
who grow horny<br>
to see death<br>
personified.)<br>

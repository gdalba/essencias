I send this apocryphal telegram,<br>
not to the generals, those who sleep in clean beds,<br>
nor to presidents, senators, and other insignificants<br>
of our beloved and idolized homeland,<br>
but to the last scraps of humanity still standing<br>
in this army too tired to exist.<br>

“News: depression<br>
has won the last two battles.<br>
It won without honor, as always do<br>
the things that kill us from the inside.<br>
No tanks, no gunfire, no grenades,<br>
just the weight of waking up to yet another morning<br>
without reason, without purpose, without coffee.<br>

There are those who’ve already lost hope —<br>
deserters of their own minds,<br>
cowards slouched into their own bodies,<br>
vagabonds of thought,<br>
all of them worthy of my envy!<br>
For I, unfortunate among the still-thinking,<br>
still scream in the inner trenches,<br>
still bathe, still write verses,<br>
still dress myself like a person each day,<br>
lace up my boots and march toward slaughter.<br>

Oh, if only it were a visible war!<br>
If only there were blood — if only it smelled like gunpowder<br>
instead of the stench of a wet pillow,<br>
instead of the growl of a stomach that eats<br>
every other day.<br>
If only there were an enemy in uniform,<br>
a tormentor with medals and a moustache,<br>
instead of this impersonal absence<br>
gnawing at my will to live from the edges in.<br>

But hear this:<br>
there is still war at the front.<br>
There are still maps on the makeshift table,<br>
once a living tree, now a tool<br>
for war and destruction.<br>
There are still plans, though no one reads them.<br>
There is still poetry — that last ridiculous trench<br>
where I pretend to have ammunition.<br>

And maybe — who knows —<br>
there’s still a midnight yet to come<br>
where from afar one might hear<br>
the limping march<br>
of those who keep trying."<br>

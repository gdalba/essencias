## The Banquet

At the banquet sat the magicians, with their emptied spells,<br>
the alchemists and their formulas of wayward hope,<br>
the philosophers, inert before their own questions,<br>
and the murderers sharing bread with their forgotten victims.<br><br>

All conversed among themselves, as if existence were dialogue.<br>
Though none had waited for me, I came.<br>
I arrived with the lateness proper to those who never belong.<br><br>

I sat in the armchair of ancient thorns â€” now soft as habit.<br>
I sat with my depersonalized pain.<br><br>

With a weary soul and an irremediable gaze,<br>
I observed the remains, the crumbs of ideas,<br>
glasses of empty intentions, bottles of spilled promises.<br><br>

Where once hearts had pulsed, there were only vestiges of affection.<br>
In the glances, the tepid veneer of hidden judgment.<br>
My cries for help dissolved into the air<br>
like the last echo of a will that no longer belongs to me.<br><br>

They were lost among the verses of a distant poet,<br>
who recited to no one<br>
and yet was present.<br><br>

He recited as if time were his accomplice<br>
and did not notice that, in the most uninhabited corner of the table,<br>
I sat not whole but still present.<br><br>

Those verses, once warmed by glimpses of being,<br>
slowly turned into a space of absence:<br>
the colors withered like the leaves of an ontological autumn,<br>
my flesh dissolved into irrelevance,<br>
and all that remained of me was the skeleton a gaze,<br>
tragically lucid.<br><br>

Left behind were<br>
the magicians and their weary illusions,<br>
the alchemists and their sublime errors,<br>
the philosophers and their unfinished labyrinths,<br>
the murderers and the complicit silence of their victims.

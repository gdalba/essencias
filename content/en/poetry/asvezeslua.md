## Sometimes, Moon

### I

I look you in the eyes<br>
and see my hollows.<br>

Sometimes, you go dark.<br>
And I vanish with you.<br>

Other times,<br>
you shine in the place<br>
where something once lacked in me.<br>

### II

Sometimes, Moon lies down on rooftops,<br>
and in her craters echo the sounds<br>
of my childhood.<br>

Sometimes, Moon sharpens her nails on the sky,<br>
and scratches me<br>
with forgotten memories.<br>

Sometimes, Moon drinks me slowly,<br>
like venom spilled through time.<br>

And sometimes, only sometimes,<br>
the hole in my chest pulses up there<br>
suspended, round,<br>
like the eye of the world<br>
refusing to shut.<br>

### III

I do not see you, Moon.<br>
But I know you're there.<br>

You reside in the dark sky,<br>
a vault-home of sages,<br>
of geniuses and murderers,<br>
of fathers and mothers, nephews,<br>
cousins, friends and enemies<br>
of everyone and no one, all at once.<br>

Your absence weighs<br>
more than your light.<br>
Yet you are power, etched in the laws of physics,<br>
a signal for flowers to begin<br>
their brief flight toward existence,<br>
an antithesis of what we mistake for an end.<br>

In the dark,<br>
I am all ears<br>
for what you do not say.<br>

In you,<br>
I rest what I don’t know how to feel,<br>
just as you must rest<br>
your reflective blades<br>
from the labor of illuminating<br>
things and people.<br>

New Moon, must you work<br>
again? For what?<br>
And why do you dance your place in the sky?<br>

Not for unpredictability.<br>
You are product<br>
of past astronomers' equations.<br>

Not for will. None of us acts from will.<br>
Some of us, like you,<br>
withdraw from life.<br>

Let the questions be asked<br>
by drunkards and philosophers.<br>
Go on and rest, New Moon,<br>
for you are a laborer like us<br> 
and if you don’t work,<br>
you starve.

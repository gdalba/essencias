## Nem Sempre

Sometimes I write about love,<br>
not always.<br>
Sometimes I write about butterflies,<br>
not always.<br><br>

Sometimes a pain invades my chest,<br>
and the thought that I once loved<br>
makes me vomit,<br>
not always.<br><br>

Sometimes I cry through the whole night,<br>
sometimes I laugh and love life,<br>
not always.<br><br>

Sometimes I talk to God,<br>
sometimes I curse the whole sky,<br>
not always.<br><br>

Sometimes I believe in new beginnings,<br>
sometimes I’m just tired dressed as hope,<br>
not always.<br><br>

Sometimes the sway of a brunette enchants me,<br>
sometimes it’s her voice, sometimes it’s her story,<br>
not always.<br><br>

Sometimes the mirror says I’m hideous,<br>
sometimes the mirror reflects nothing at all,<br>
not always.<br><br>

Sometimes I dream myself a genius,<br>
sometimes I can’t even form a thought,<br>
not always.<br><br>

Sometimes life makes sense,<br>
sometimes even crying has no reason,<br>
not always.<br><br>

Sometimes I think I’ll leave a legacy,<br>
sometimes I fear I’m just another faded name,<br>
not always.<br><br>

Sometimes the morning kisses me softly,<br>
sometimes it spits on me with disgust,<br>
not always.<br><br>

Sometimes I die of missing you,<br>
sometimes I feel like running back to you,<br>
not always.<br><br>

Sometimes what dazzles me in God is faith,<br>
sometimes it’s the silence He keeps that frightens me,<br>
not always.<br><br>

Sometimes I am all calm and tide,<br>
sometimes just a storm unraveling,<br>
not always.<br><br>

Sometimes my sorrow leads me to the word,<br>
sometimes life just drags on,<br>
not always.<br><br>

Sometimes I think of dying,<br>
sometimes I think even more of dying,<br>
not always.

I miss her so much, my friend...<br>
I miss her gaze,<br>
the almond-shaped eyes,<br>
the black hair and the strands<br>
I used to gather every day from the bathroom floor.<br>

I miss her round little cheeks,<br>
which I watched so closely<br>
until I lost myself in foolish loves.<br>
I miss when she would say 亲亲, 抱抱, 贴贴,<br>
and let me dive into a sea of another language,<br>
another culture, another life.<br>

I miss when she complained<br>
that my arm was heavy before sleeping.<br>
I miss watching her focused,<br>
and quietly toasting her intelligence<br>
just to myself.<br>

I miss seeing her cross the street,<br>
tasting our first ice cream,<br>
holding her hand for the first time<br>
and all else that the tears<br>
no longer allow me to remember.<br>

What a lament!<br>
She tears apart the factory of my existence<br>
when I least need it,<br>
when I most need it,<br>
when I am nothing,<br>
and when I am everything.<br>
When I want everything,<br>
and when I want absolutely nothing.<br>

She is, indeed, a great parasite.<br>
And perhaps I was cruel<br>
to enter her life.<br>

But what greater cruelty<br>
than to give me back everything threefold<br>
the pain,<br>
the longing,<br>
the sadness.

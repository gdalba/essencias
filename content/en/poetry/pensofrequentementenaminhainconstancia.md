and how I sail within it the aching uncertainties<br>
of this life.<br>

I see myself at the crossroads<br>
of poorly chosen choices,<br>
of poorly lived lives.<br>
Of moments of sorrow and joy.<br>

When I am sad, I thank God<br>
for taking you from my life.<br>
And when I am happy, all I want<br>
is you within it.<br>

And in this uncertainty I am deeply unsettled.<br>
So I decide it would be better<br>
to dissolve myself — until even the very atoms<br>
that compose me<br>
forget me.<br>

And in that, perhaps, I would find<br>
a million alternative paths,<br>
where my sorrows<br>
would turn into joy,<br>
and you would be part of my life.

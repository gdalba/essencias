## Calendar of Monotony

Yesterday, by accident, I looked at the calendar.<br>
It was a block of repeated days,<br>
a bureaucratic parade of tedium —<br>
save for those dates once etched<br>
in pencil and longing:<br>
our monthly anniversaries.<br>

We celebrated like sinners at a sacred altar,<br>
a forbidden devotion,<br>
a crime against the First Commandment.<br>
Then it became a ritual,<br>
a silent treaty against forgetting.<br>
Until, at last,<br>
it was merely a crooked face of memory,<br>
half-drunken, half-fevered.<br>

In those dates,<br>
we searched for some trace of what we once were —<br>
or fancied ourselves to be.<br>

But yesterday, again, I looked.<br>
And found nothing.<br>
No you,<br>
no dates,<br>
no us.<br>

Just scribbles from the day I planted sunflowers<br>
(as if flowers could save me)<br>
a few saint’s days,<br>
some reminders about overdue bills,<br>
and mostly,<br>
an enormous white expanse,<br>
staring back at me with the coldness of one who says<br>
that I have a dreadful laziness for living.<br>

This calendar full of minor uselessness<br>
mirrors my life with poetic precision.<br>
So I decided to change it.<br>
I read in the grimoires of self-help —<br>
those dime-store scriptures of bottled hope —<br>
that rearranging your days is a good start.<br>

But truth be told,<br>
I learned I had turned sixty when I was still fifteen,<br>
with the kind of wisdom — if you dare call it that —<br>
of someone who hasn’t existed five minutes yet.<br>

And when I think of the road still ahead,<br>
its kilometers of repetition and protocol,<br>
I feel an overwhelming urge<br>
not to live,<br>
but to pull over somewhere quiet<br>
and vanish into the woods<br>
like a tired animal<br>
unfit for the season.

## The Ranking of Women

First, there’s you<br>
and then,<br>
all the rest.

## The Gaze on the Train

Dozens of glances<br>
all around us,<br>
and I have eyes only for you.<br>

How is it possible?<br>
What spell have you cast on me,<br>
that I cry like a baby<br>
at the mere sight of you?

## Cheeks

There’s an entire world<br>
in your cheeks.<br>
I live there too,<br>
and all my loves<br>
live there as well.

## Unconditional

The love I have for you<br>
is purely unconditional:<br>
it exists when we argue,<br>
it shows when we love,<br>
and it endlessly persists<br>
even in daily insecurities.<br>
Loving you is unconditionally mundane.<br>
And I love you, and there are no conditions<br>
that could stop me from loving you.

## The Flower – Xi’An

A small yellow flower<br>
blooms in the city of Xi’An,<br>
and there blooms as well<br>
my only chance to love in this life.<br>
What joy! In Xi’An blooms<br>
a little yellow flower.<br>
And with it blooms too<br>
the love in me.<br>

I’m going to Xi’An, to raise a monument<br>
to my little yellow flower. I’ll plant<br>
some others, tulips and<br>
orchids and sunflowers,<br>
and maybe even another lily.<br>

And I will love deeply<br>
my little yellow flower.

## The First

There is a first time for everything:<br>
for love, for kindness,<br>
for lightness, for peace,<br>
for seeing your walk<br>
soft upon the clouds, for seeing<br>
the brown crystals of your eyes<br>
appreciate me wholly, for feeling<br>
the warmth of your embrace, for massaging<br>
your arms. There is a first time<br>
for love, and if God wills,<br>
it will be the last.

## Insecurities?

I love you, but sometimes<br>
I think you don’t love me.<br>
Sometimes I die a little<br>
with these insecurities,<br>
so why not settle it<br>
and just say you love me?

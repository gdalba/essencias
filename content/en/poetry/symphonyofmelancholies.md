When you love,<br>
rise to the sonatas of Chopin,<br>
and let yourself fall — until you overflow —<br>
into the concertos of Sibelius,<br>
into the deep breathing<br>
of the Philharmonic of Berlin.<br>

And the tremors will tremble,<br>
as they truly do,<br>
in the restless strings of Beijing.<br>

And when you love, remember to weep yourself entirely,<br>
with the vertiginous cries of Paganini,<br>
with manifolded tears<br>
in the operas of Puccini.<br>

Move your hips! Come, Villa-Lobos —<br>
with your tropics in dissonance.<br>
Come, Bach, with your architecture of infinity.<br>
Come, Vivaldi, with your cycles<br>
that insist on repeating.<br>

Love! Oh! Love deeply!<br>
Love<br>
as if loving were a wounded sonata,<br>
bleeding through the alleyways of Vancouver,<br>
where the erudite kiss stumbles over flesh<br>
and moans its way out in D minor.<br>

When you love,<br>
do not fear the opera —<br>
cry out with Verdi<br>
as one who loses country, child, faith,<br>
and still cries out! And how he cries!<br>

Then plunge into the abysses of Rachmaninoff,<br>
with Rimsky-Korsakov,<br>
where the piano weighs a thousand tons of longing<br>
and every chord is an erratic hand,<br>
a methodical bee,<br>
that touches, seduces, fails — and fails to not return.<br>

Learn from Boccherini<br>
that even lightness carries discipline,<br>
and from Purcell<br>
that pain may walk softly, in measured steps,<br>
that a procession need not dare to weep aloud.<br>

Love with the impossible clarity of Mozart,<br>
where joy is born already knowing it will end.<br>
Love with Beethoven,<br>
deaf to the world and full of thunder,<br>
ripping fate apart with mute, clenched fists —<br>
this is how one loves<br>
when permission is no longer asked.<br>

Invoke Glinka —<br>
great Glinka! —<br>
who founded a nation in melody<br>
and taught us that to love<br>
is also to invent its people<br>
so as not to go (so) mad alone.<br>

And dance! Even knowing the end:<br>
dance with Saint-Saëns<br>
in the Danse Macabre,<br>
where bones crack into rhythm<br>
and death itself learns, embarrassed,<br>
to laugh.<br>

Love with Tchaikovsky,<br>
excessive, wounded, irreconcilable.<br>
Love with Dvořák,<br>
hearing home even while far from it.<br>
Love with Grieg,<br>
where landscape enters thy chest<br>
and love learns to be silence<br>
between the mountains.<br>

Love with Elgar<br>
and his tired nobility,<br>
his love marching on even when wounded.<br>
Love with Debussy,<br>
who dissolves desire into light,<br>
turns waiting into a shade of blue,<br>
touch into water impossible to hold.<br>

And when love deafens you,<br>
when the entire world is playing inside you,<br>
then be silent.<br>

Be silent like Schubert.<br>

And die slowly,<br>
in a short lied,<br>
accepting the end without heroism,<br>
in a love that no longer shouts.<br>

And let silence finish<br>
this symphony<br>
of melancholies.<br>

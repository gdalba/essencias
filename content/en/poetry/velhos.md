The first thing to grow old<br>
are our infant habits.<br>
Then grow old the new perceptions<br>
we once had of the world.<br>

The people around us grow old:<br>
first our parents,<br>
then our friends,<br>
later our loves.<br>

We notice our bodies grow old,<br>
and then our minds.<br>
Sometimes in reverse order,<br>
but always, inevitably,<br>
everything grows old.<br>
And at last,<br>
our will to live grows old.<br>

Our laughter grows old<br>
as teeth yellow, bend,<br>
and finally fall away.<br>
We no longer lift our eyes<br>
to divine wonder,<br>
for our backs are bent downward,<br>
in their penance.<br>

At last the heart grows old.<br>
And then, the wood that wraps us.<br>
And then, the earth that covers us.<br>
And then, the world goes on aging,<br>
while we no longer doâ€”<br>
because we cannot.<br>

And yet,<br>
we are all old.<br>

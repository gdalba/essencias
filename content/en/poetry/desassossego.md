Life is a parade of monotony,<br>
mundane, so very mundane.<br>
The plants we plant<br>
do not sprout, and thus<br>
they do not die.<br>
And so,<br>
we grow bored<br>
staring at soft soil,<br>
wondering if we fit there,<br>
seven feet beneath the surface.<br>
If that’s where we deserve to be.<br>
If there is another place<br>
to call home.<br>
If this is our home.<br>
If up there, in the sky,<br>
a home exists.<br>
And if there is no<br>
such thing as a home,<br>
then where shall we look?<br>

But even in the most<br>
mundane lives, things change.<br>
Loves arrive,<br>
they rattle the fabric of existence,<br>
and then they go away.<br>
They leave us sorrowful…<br>
But then we forget,<br>
and we love again,<br>
and love the same person,<br>
and then another person,<br>
and then <em>Fernando Pessoa</em>,<br>
but never ourselves.<br>
We, ourselves,<br>
grow bored again,<br>
until the first sunflower<br>
breaks through the soil,<br>
that job offer comes,<br>
and we think of<br>
paying the bills,<br>
of buying a new pair of pants,<br>
of giving money to family…<br>
Then we remember<br>
we hate our families,<br>
so we look for a new love<br>
to spend that money on.<br>
But work is expensive:<br>
it costs us our backs<br>
and our enthusiasm.<br>
Soon, we no longer make love.<br>
And we marry, desperate<br>
to love.<br>

But love what?

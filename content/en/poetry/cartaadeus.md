## Letter to God

Dear God,<br>
I had a good day today.<br>
And I hope You did too.<br>
That You witnessed more acts of kindness,<br>
more remnants of humanity<br>
than of vileness.<br>

I had the pleasure of conversation<br>
with someone I care about deeply.<br>
I spoke to her of grief — of people, and of things —<br>
and she wept.<br>
But then we laughed,<br>
and befriended a drunk man drinking wine.<br>

The beauty of Vancouver embraced me —<br>
the pine trees, as comrades,<br>
cast their shade upon me.<br>
It was warm, but not too much.<br>

I practiced, once again, the craft of poetry.<br>
Thank You, God, for granting me<br>
this ancient gift that sometimes returns,<br>
like the sun after the rain,<br>
revealing itself in the seven colors of the rainbow.<br>

I loved my parents.<br>
I thought a lot about my brother.<br>
I recalled the ethereal dream of paradise,<br>
where Your face and his seemed to become one.<br>

I reflected on the deadly sins,<br>
interpreted them —<br>
and in either penance or guilt, I avoided them.<br>
And more than that, I gave myself the right,<br>
yes, the right,<br>
to buy a more expensive loaf of bread.<br>

I spoke with a kind old man.<br>
We talked about who we are,<br>
where we come from,<br>
and where we’re going.<br>
And I, once so ashamed of my speech,<br>
spoke with the ease of one<br>
who masters many languages.<br>
We told each other<br>
that moments like those warm the heart.<br>

God, I thought a lot about Sara.<br>
At first,<br>
came anguish.<br>
Then came serenity.<br>
Then came beauty, gratitude, lightness —<br>
for having loved and been loved<br>
by someone so beautiful<br>
in all her most metaphysical layers.<br>

I felt longing.<br>
And I asked myself:<br>
am I supposed to feel it?<br>
God, is it right to miss her this much?<br>
On my happiest day, should I still want her?<br>
And on my saddest too?<br>

I made her a promise in thought:<br>
that I would write a poem each day<br>
if she came to talk to me —<br>
but not to mention me,<br>
only to speak of herself.<br>

I acknowledged my human nature<br>
and promised that if I failed that vow,<br>
I’d fulfill it the next day.<br>

Then I took it back.<br>
Told myself she doesn’t need to come back to love me —<br>
only to come.<br>
To tell me about her day,<br>
about the many days I no longer share.<br>

All I want is to know<br>
everything that passes through that beautiful mind —<br>
stubborn, yes, sometimes — but who isn’t?<br>
If I am too, then others may be as well.<br>

I revisited many of my mistakes,<br>
but also gave myself the right<br>
to revisit one — just one — success.<br>
As if I, too, were entitled<br>
to be human.<br>

God, may she have shared with me<br>
the beauty of the sky licking the mountain’s back<br>
in orange tones —<br>
and may You have renewed<br>
my hope<br>
in You and in Your humanity.<br>

And in the end I asked myself:<br>
if You took my life right now,<br>
would I die happy?<br>

The truth is, God,<br>
I don’t know.<br>
But I have tomorrow<br>
to try again.

On the day I died, I could not<br>
say goodbye. In my madness,<br>
I was still folding sheets beside you,<br>
still offering you warm water,<br>
still speaking the hollow words of love.<br>

In the final breath of my being,<br>
my fingers entwined with yours<br>
one last time — as they did the first,<br>
and I watched, astonished,<br>
as you asked for my kiss<br>
for the very first time.<br>

Upon the bed of my death,<br>
I watched you fall ill for the first time,<br>
and I remember forgetting everything, everything,<br>
and praying, for the first time,<br>
for your well-being.<br>

In the losing of all feeling,<br>
I watched, unbelieving,<br>
as you asked me to be yours<br>
for the first time — and, unbelieving, I saw myself<br>
naked, vulnerable, far from the shells<br>
that once protected me.<br>
And still more unbelieving, I saw<br>
you did not recoil in disgust<br>
or sadness — and yet you loved me still.<br>

As my throat went dry, I recall<br>
practicing, with two pens, the art of chopsticks,<br>
so I would not shame myself before you,<br>
for the first time.<br>
I remember crying, and crying, and crying<br>
for every time I had loved you so much.<br>

As my eyes dried, I prayed one last time<br>
for your well-being, and I loved you<br>
one last time.<br>
And I watched you slowly forget me —<br>
I saw you struggle, wander toward a place<br>
where all our first times<br>
and last times converge,<br>
and are reborn,<br>
and die again,<br>
and are reborn once more,<br>
and leave you resting<br>
on the stone benches of Xi’an.<br>

And I watched you bloom once more,<br>
like the radioactive rose of Hiroshima.<br>
I saw you empress,<br>
I saw you dominatrix,<br>
I saw you as embryo,<br>
as thunder,<br>
as endless river,<br>
as immense silence,<br>
as soft laughter,<br>
as executioner,<br>
as judge<br>
on the final day.<br>

I saw you, saw you deeply,<br>
and kissed you deeply,<br>
and worshiped you deeply,<br>
and made you my goddess —<br>
spitting toward Iris,<br>
mocking Athena,<br>
for you alone are divine.<br>

As my eyes closed, I watched you,<br>
one last time,<br>
forget me.<br>

And now I wish to forget myself.<br>
I wish to fall ill of all your illnesses,<br>
to receive all your pain,<br>
to cradle all your tears,<br>
to strike down all your sorrow.<br>

And I wish you to be<br>
so, so happy.<br>

I watch you, one last time,<br>
forget me.<br>

I watch you,<br>
one last time.

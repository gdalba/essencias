A good relationship is one<br>
I shape with my own hands.<br>
My wants, my opinions,<br>
my tastes and even my refusals<br>
come from me alone.<br>
What we do on Saturdays and Sundays,<br>
how I rise in the mornings,<br>
which side I turn to when night arrives,<br>
what becomes of my birthday, where we dine,<br>
under which acid rain we set a crystal glass<br>
and drink its poisoned water after,<br>
and then, when we fight, who is right,<br>
and how one kneels for forgiveness,<br>
and which god we pray to,<br>
which song we choose,<br>
and on what day, at last, we die.<br>

And this vast arrogance ruins me.<br>
Sour demons fasten their chains.<br>
Bile seeps into the corners of my tears,<br>
and vultures celebrate<br>
carrying pieces of me through the sky.<br>

What is left<br>
is a skull tossed aside.<br>
No one will ever know<br>
if it died smiling<br>
or if it lived its only dream:<br>
to be loved<br>
exactly as it always wanted.

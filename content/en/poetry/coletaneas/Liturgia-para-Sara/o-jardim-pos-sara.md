After she flew, the garden remained.<br>

But not a blooming garden,<br>
not green, not full of promise.<br>
What remained was a field of dead roots,<br>
soil that no longer accepts seeds.<br>

What remained was me.<br>

The butterfly left with lightness,<br>
and I sank beneath the weight —<br>
the weight of consequence.<br>
She took the brightness with her,<br>
and left me with the shadow —<br>
the shadow of uncertainty.<br>

The sunflower that had bloomed for her<br>
withered unseen.<br>
No petal remains.<br>
It no longer turns to the sun, nor bends to the wind.<br>

And now the metaphysical self walks this barren field,<br>
speaking to flowers that do not exist,<br>
praying to verses no one reads,<br>
shouting a name that no longer answers.<br>

"You wanted the poem to touch —<br>
and it did.<br>
But it did not touch her.<br>
It touched only you.<br>
Like a blade that touches its own hand.<br>

You wrote with the blood of adoration,<br>
and she read with the eyes of distraction.<br>
If she read.<br>

If she even looked.<br>

Now, the garden is something else —<br>
it is posthumous.<br>
Each part of it tells you:<br>
It’s not just that she didn’t return.<br>
It’s that no one ever will."<br>

Because the soil has closed.<br>
Because the miracle was only once.<br>
Because beauty, when burned,<br>
becomes a curse.<br>

No new sunflower will be born.<br>
No new wings will come.<br>

Only the echo of a gesture no one saw,<br>
only the memory of a light<br>
that never reached the heart it was meant for.<br>

And I, who was once a temple,<br>
am now a ruin.<br>

And I, who was once a verse,<br>
am now the silence between verses.<br>

And I, who was once the garden,<br>
am now the dust.<br>
The dust that still waits,<br>
that still dreams,<br>
but knows —<br>
knows with the firm pain of knowing —<br>
that no other butterfly will come.<br>

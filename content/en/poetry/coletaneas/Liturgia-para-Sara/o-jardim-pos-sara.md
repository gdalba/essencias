After she flew, the garden remained.<br>
It remained the way things linger<br>
when they’ve been seen too much:<br>
quiet,<br>
wrapped in a kind of weariness.<br>

The ground holds traces of light footsteps,<br>
but no longer asks for a path.<br>
Roots sleep beneath the earth,<br>
and the air around<br>
seems to carry a warm memory.<br>

I remained as well.<br>
Or perhaps I kept staying<br>
with the hours that slip from an unfinished gesture.<br>

She went on <br>
like a flight that does not repeat itself,<br>
but leaves in the sky<br>
the memory of having been possible.<br>

The weight arrived slowly,<br>
settling on my shoulders<br>
like time when it no longer needs to be measured.<br>

Where the sunflower once bloomed,<br>
the earth shelters a yellow silence.<br>
There is still a hint of light<br>
in the way the leaves lie still.<br>

The body walks among shapes<br>
that never needed to exist.<br>
It speaks words that expect no hearing.<br>
A prayer folds itself<br>
midway through the sentence.<br>

The name endures —<br>
and that is enough.<br>

The poem touched where the skin was open.<br>
It made a home.<br>
It remains in the flesh,<br>
even if the eyes never gathered it.<br>

Perhaps it was read,<br>
or merely brushed by the wind.<br>
But what is offered<br>
does not ask to be received.<br>

The garden aligns with time.<br>
Falling petals<br>
take part in a dance<br>
without audience.<br>

Nothing here waits for miracles.<br>
Beauty fulfilled its cycle<br>
in the instant it was whole.<br>

No wing returns,<br>
but in the air<br>
there is a trembling from an ancient flight.<br>

The gesture remains,<br>
even if no one saw it.<br>
The gleam remains,<br>
even if it never reached its intended heart.<br>

And I, who once sheltered that presence,<br>
am now open space,<br>
folded inward.<br>

And I, who once spoke in verses,<br>
am the pause between sounds.<br>

And I, who was a garden,<br>
am light matter,<br>
carried by breath alone.<br>

I remain.<br>
In the dream that still moves,<br>
in the waiting that asks for no shape,<br>
knowing —<br>
knowing without wound —<br>
that there was flight.<br>

And that is real.

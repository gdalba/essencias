A butterfly landed on my chest,<br>
like one who settles into an old couch,<br>
where everything has already been waiting.<br>

There was no asking,<br>
no promise.<br>
Only the moment.<br>

I, serene earth, breathed in.<br>
And from the depth of quiet ground,<br>
a sunflower was born.<br>

But I did not plant it.<br>
It came.<br>
As forgotten names come<br>
in the middle of a dream.<br>

It rose slowly,<br>
touching the sky without urgency,<br>
its petals unfolding<br>
in gestures that do not wish to end.<br>

And the sunflower, light as one who knows how to leave,<br>
lifted the butterfly,<br>
and she flew.<br>
The light found her wings.<br>

And I remained,<br>
my chest still in bloom,<br>
my time still open,<br>
my gesture still whole.<br>

Some speak of other passages,<br>
when the day grows heavier than words.<br>

Sometimes, the butterfly lands<br>
and all remains silent.<br>
The ground breathes dry,<br>
and the miracle sleeps.<br>

Sometimes, the sunflower rushes,<br>
grows too tall,<br>
reaches high as if forgetting its own beginning —<br>
and touches the sun before its time.<br>

The wing unravels slowly,<br>
burns, fades,<br>
and memory takes the place of flight.<br>

Sara, your eyes did not see,<br>
but it was all for you.<br>
The sunflower, the breath,<br>
the entire garden of my chest.<br>

Even unread,<br>
there were verses.<br>
Even unanswered,<br>
there were roots.<br>

Each petal was a poem.<br>
Each stanza, an offering.<br>

And if no other butterfly ever lands,<br>
the earth remains here.<br>
Being.<br>
Enduring.<br>
Living among the seeds.<br>

Still trying to believe that love’s landing<br>
is something that does not burn,<br>
even after the end.

A butterfly landed on my chest,<br>
as one might land on sacred ground<br>
without asking, without promising.<br>

I, quiet earth, breathed deep.<br>
And from the silence, a sunflower was born.<br>

I did not plant it, it was born.<br>
From nothing.<br>
From you.<br>

It stretched skyward with gentleness,<br>
unfolding petals like arms,<br>
in a slow gesture, almost a prayer.<br>

And in a tender miracle,<br>
the sunflower, with no roots of ego,<br>
lifted the butterfly back into the air.<br>
Returned what earth could not hold.<br>

She flew.<br>
Flew with light on her wings,<br>
and I remained —<br>
open soil,<br>
in bloom,<br>
in mourning.<br>

But there is another story, sometimes told<br>
when the day is too gray for poetry:<br>

A butterfly landed on me,<br>
but the garden did not respond.<br>
Dry ground.<br>
Will gone.<br>

She waited for the miracle<br>
but no sunflower broke through.<br>

Or, perhaps worse:<br>
a sunflower did grow,<br>
but too ambitious,<br>
too reckless,<br>
lifting her so high<br>
she brushed the sun.<br>

And burned.<br>

Her wings turned to ash,<br>
her body, longing,<br>
her beauty, memory of a mistake.<br>

Sara, you did not see —<br>
but that sunflower was yours.<br>
That butterfly, my gift.<br>
That garden, my chest.<br>

And even if your eyes<br>
never lingered on my poems,<br>
every verse was a petal.<br>
Every rhyme, a root.<br>
Every stanza, an offering.<br>

And even if nothing blossoms,<br>
I remain<br>
soil that waits,<br>
soil that dreams,<br>
soil that still believes<br>
that love might land<br>
without burning.

summary: "You are not a half, nor a shadow of another."

You are not a half, nor a shadow of another.<br>
You are not a memory in someone else’s name,<br>
nor a hidden word folded in time.<br>
You are Sara,<br>
and you pour yourself whole<br>
into me.<br>

You are the first step of dawn,<br>
the blade that cuts between dream and waking,<br>
the thirst no wine can quench.<br>

You come without prayers, without crown, without guilt.<br>
You are no saint, no flower —<br>
you are the pulse that wounds and heals.<br>

In you, love is not a promise,<br>
it is slow fire,<br>
raw flesh,<br>
truth as bare as a stone at noon.<br>

Your name echoes and remains.<br>
It scatters and inscribes<br>
upon the tablet of my chest,<br>
like biblical law,<br>
like Divine commandment.<br>

You are what Maria once whispered<br>
without knowing how to say.<br>
What others sought<br>
without knowing how to see.<br>

Sara, you are the final word<br>
in the poem no one dared to end.

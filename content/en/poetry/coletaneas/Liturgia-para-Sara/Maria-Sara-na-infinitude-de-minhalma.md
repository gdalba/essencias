Maria wandered<br>
without a guide,<br>
and made, Maria,<br>
my joy abide.<br>

But within Sara’s gaze<br>
the world grows still—<br>
and Maria’s name<br>
sinks deep in will.<br>

There is no more Maria<br>
in breath of life,<br>
in fate’s soft song,<br>
in alleyway strife.<br>

But hidden like shadow<br>
in the rarest of light,<br>
a flicker remains:<br>
her name is Sara.<br>

A cold wind calls itself Maria,<br>
waves of love wherever she’d be.<br>
But I alone knew, as the tide pulled her far,<br>
that the name that burned deep — was Sara.<br>

Maria now sleeps<br>
in a feathery bed,<br>
in the darkest part<br>
of my heart, unsaid.<br>

But it’s Sara who dreams<br>
where the world folds in two,<br>
in silence so deep,<br>
in devotion true.<br>

There are many Marias,<br>
with comings and goings,<br>
Marias that lived,<br>
Marias unknowing.<br>

But the one never shown,<br>
the one that won’t sever,<br>
the one time disguises—<br>
that one is Sara.<br>

Saintly Marias,<br>
and Marias in bloom,<br>
verses of old<br>
that time resumes.<br>

Yet among them all,<br>
of faith and lore,<br>
none rise above<br>
my Sara’s core.<br><br>

Maria is the chant<br>
in every prayer’s tone.<br>
But Sara is the name<br>
etched in my own.

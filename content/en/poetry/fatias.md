## Slices

A woman, eventually, will sit beside me<br>
and — with a dying kind of innocence — she'll ask<br>
if I’ve ever loved.<br>
And I’ll say yes.<br>
And that I never will again.<br>

She’ll get curious, of course, and bother me profoundly.<br>
And I’ll be forced to summon the filthiest metaphors I’ve got:<br>
That love and hunger are sisters, one leans on the other.<br>
We love and go hungry, and eventually,<br>
we hunger for love.<br>

This poor thing who sat by my side<br>
will come to see I’ve starved before.<br>
That now I feed<br>
on poetry and back-alley philosophy.<br>

And then, poor soul,<br>
she’ll have to answer me this:<br>
how could the one who came before —<br>
who ate every last thing I had —<br>
still died of hunger?

## Slices

When the next woman sits beside me<br>
and, between sips, asks if I’m romantic,<br>
I’ll say:<br>
“Am I? No. I was!”<br>

I won’t say it out of bitterness.<br>
Bitterness is a right I barely deserve<br>
(though I do taste of it).<br>
No, it’s just that what I had, I gave.<br>
Gave without measure, without caution,<br>
without a backup plan.<br>

Love, I thought,<br>
was meant to be handed over whole<br>
like fresh bread from the oven:<br>
you share it with whoever’s hungry,<br>
and you eat too, and you sin in gluttony,<br>
only to realize,<br>
on the third day without food,<br>
that you’re starving too.<br>

To this new one, to this whoever she may be, nothing remains.<br>
Not even a crust left on the plate.<br>
Poor thing — she arrived after the feast,<br>
when the floor was already being swept<br>
of what was left of the two of us.<br>

Poor thing, mind you.<br>
No one told me love was meant to be rationed.<br>
A slice today, another tomorrow,<br>
save some here, a bit there,<br>
in case winter came early.<br>

But if you decide to stay, poor thing, you shall serve me to philosophy.<br>
Tell me: why, to her,<br>
I gave everything<br>
and still<br>
she was starving?

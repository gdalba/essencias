A few months ago, my love left me.<br>
She didn’t die, didn’t fall ill,<br>
just vanished into the horizon.<br>

Not even that.<br>
She lives a few blocks up the street,<br>
breathes the same air I do,<br>
cries the same tears I do.<br>

Writes the same poetry I write,<br>
shares the same dreams I dream,<br>
wanted — truly wanted — the same love I did.<br>

And not even that.<br>
She left little by little,<br>
responding to my petty neglects,<br>
to the mental illnesses that pollute my ability to love.<br>

Tragicomic:<br>
my one time loving someone<br>
ended in hatred,<br>
in a puddle of bile spilled<br>
at the heel of badly lived lives.<br>

In my mind, she’s dead,<br>
as if that fixed anything,<br>
as if this dumb, disgusting lie<br>
could challenge the guilt that<br>
is entirely mine.<br>

In repentance, I pray every day<br>
to God, to fate, to whatever.<br>
I’ve become a gambling addict:<br>
if this rose grows, she’ll come back to me.<br>
If this food doesn’t burn, she’ll return.<br>
If a white car passes by, she’s mine again.<br>

And the roses grow,<br>
the food turns out perfect,<br>
the cars keep passing,<br>
the prayers are heard<br>
and still, she doesn’t come back.<br>

It’s truly tragicomic:<br>
to love the only love I’ve ever had,<br>
to be loved in return,<br>
and still fail to appreciate it.<br>

So I’ll read The Clouds,<br>
rebrand myself a humble sophist,<br>
argue she was wrong from the start.<br>

And I’ll sleep.<br>
And I’ll dream.<br>
And she’ll be there,<br>
always.<br>

And one day I’ll die.<br>
And this whole tragicomic farce<br>
will die with me.

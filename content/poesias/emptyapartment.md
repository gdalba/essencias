What happened here?<br>
A Vancouver sunset licked those windows.<br>
What happened here?<br>
No light ever came on.<br>

The balcony hosts no soul.<br>
The writer I once saw<br>
is no more.<br>

What’s it all for?<br>
This corner of the sixth floor<br>
doesn’t hold you anymore.<br>

What happened here?<br>
It’s all too dark, it grows uncanny.<br>
The owner must be in pain.<br>
I haven’t seen you through all this rain —<br>
what made you disappear?<br>

Who lived here?<br>
It must have been a river:<br>
I see the water slipping<br>
beneath the door.<br>

Who lived here?<br>
It must have been someone who cared deeply.<br>
A garden still lives<br>
in front of her door.<br>
She must have weeded out the tears<br>
and learned to mourn no more.<br>

So I decided to knock.<br>
And I’ve been knocking.<br>
But no one answers.<br>

I’ve been knocking —<br>
oh, I’ve been knocking —<br>
most of the day.<br>

And I’ve been calling,<br>
and I’ve been calling:<br>
“Oh, Sara,<br>
can’t you come out to play?”<br>

And I’ve been knocking,<br>
and I’ve been calling:<br>
Sara, can’t you come out to play<br>
in this empty garden?<br>

Sara,<br>
can’t you come out to play<br>
in this empty garden?
